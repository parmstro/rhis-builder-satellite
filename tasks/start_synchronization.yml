# synchronization of repositories

# if you skip synchronization and
# you added kickstart repos to your product and content views
# satellite doesnt register the kickstart repos as synchronized content (obviously)
# new definitions like hostgroups then fail with bad content definitions
# avoid setting skip_sync_all or skip_publish_all in your variable file
# call it with an extravar instead
